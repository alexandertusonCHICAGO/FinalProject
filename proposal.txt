I want to build an electromagnetic particle simulator that models how 
particles react to electromagnetic radiation. The program will take a few
parameters, run calculations, and return the results. I can provide more
details about the specifics of the calculations that I want to be able to run,
its basically maxwells equations. I want it to have a couple different
functionalities to solve a couple different types of problems.

I think the project satisfies the complexity requirements, it involves fairly 
complex numerical calculations. I plan to use algebraic data types to model 
different components of the similation like the particles, atmospheric layers 
and wave information. I will most likely use higher order functions because I
think I want to see how a wave affects multiple particles and it would be useful
to apply multiple functions to a set of objects. My program will most likely 
involve repeated updates like computing how radiation affects each layer over 
time, so I think I'll use state or monad transformers to handle those. I think 
I'll probably have to input a lot of information because the problems will 
require a lot of starting information, so I will probably use parser combinators
to help read those inputs.
